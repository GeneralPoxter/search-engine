        Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
        Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?

        Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
        Do you ever feel already buried deep?
        Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
        Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
